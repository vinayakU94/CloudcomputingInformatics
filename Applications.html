        <div class="container my-1" style=" white-space: pre-wrap;text-align: center;"> 1.Online Data Storage
            Cloud Computing allows storage and access to data like files, images, audio, and videos on the cloud
            storage. In this age of big data, storing huge volumes of business data locally requires more and more space
            and escalating costs. This is where cloud storage comes into play, where businesses can store and access
            data using multiple devices.

            The interface provided is easy to use, convenient, and has the benefits of high speed, scalability, and
            integrated security.

            2. Backup and Recovery
            Cloud service providers offer safe storage and backup facility for data and resources on the cloud. In a
            traditional computing system, data backup is a complex problem, and often, in case of a disaster, data can
            be permanently lost. But with cloud computing, data can be easily recovered with minimal damage in case of a
            disaster.

            3. Big Data Analysis
            One of the most important applications of cloud computing is its role in extensive data analysis. The
            extremely large volume of big data makes it impossible to store using traditional data management systems.
            Due to the unlimited storage capacity of the cloud, businesses can now store and analyze big data to gain
            valuable business insights.

            4. Testing and Development
            Cloud computing applications provide the easiest approach for testing and development of products. In
            traditional methods, such an environment would be time-consuming, expensive due to the setting up of IT
            resources and infrastructure, and needed manpower. However, with cloud computing, businesses get scalable
            and flexible cloud services, which they can use for product development, testing, and deployment.

            5. Antivirus Applications
            With Cloud Computing comes cloud antivirus software which is stored in the cloud from where they monitor
            viruses and malware in the organization’s system and fixes them. Earlier, organizations had to install
            antivirus software within their system and detect security threats.

            6. E-commerce Application
            Ecommerce applications in the cloud enable users and e-businesses to respond quickly to emerging
            opportunities. It offers a new approach to business leaders to make things done with minimum amount and
            minimal time. They use cloud environments to manage customer data, product data, and other operational
            systems.

            7. Cloud Computing in Education
            E-learning, online distance learning programs, and student information portals are some of the key changes
            brought about by applications of cloud computing in the education sector. In this new learning environment,
            there’s an attractive environment for learning, teaching, experimenting provided to students, teachers, and
            researchers so they can connect to the cloud of their establishment and access data and information</div>
