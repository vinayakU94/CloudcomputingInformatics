        <div class="container my-1" style=" white-space: pre-wrap;text-align: center;">Before emerging the cloud
            computing, there was Client/Server computing which is basically a centralized storage in which all the
            software applications, all the data and all the controls are resided on the server side.

            If a single user wants to access specific data or run a program, he/she need to connect to the server and
            then gain appropriate access, and then he/she can do his/her business.

            Then after, distributed computing came into picture, where all the computers are networked together and
            share their resources when needed.

            On the basis of above computing, there was emerged of cloud computing concepts that later implemented.



            At around in 1961, John MacCharty suggested in a speech at MIT that computing can be sold like a utility,
            just like a water or electricity. It was a brilliant idea, but like all brilliant ideas, it was ahead if its
            time, as for the next few decades, despite interest in the model, the technology simply was not ready for
            it.

            But of course time has passed and the technology caught that idea and after few years we mentioned that:

            In 1999, Salesforce.com started delivering of applications to users using a simple website. The applications
            were delivered to enterprises over the Internet, and this way the dream of computing sold as utility were
            true.

            In 2002, Amazon started Amazon Web Services, providing services like storage, computation and even human
            intelligence. However, only starting with the launch of the Elastic Compute Cloud in 2006 a truly commercial
            service open to everybody existed.

            In 2009, Google Apps also started to provide cloud computing enterprise applications.

            Of course, all the big players are present in the cloud computing evolution, some were earlier, some were
            later. In 2009, Microsoft launched Windows Azure, and companies like Oracle and HP have all joined the game.
            This proves that today, cloud computing has become mainstream.</div>
